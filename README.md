# Legends of Learning Plugin for Construct 3

This plugin features integration with Legends of Learning API integration for Construct 3. The plugin supports **C3 runtime only and worker mode**. C2 Runtime and Construct 2 is not supported and due to Construct 2 will soon be retired, there's no intention on developing a plugin for it.

The plugin not only provides you with API integration, but also with a couple of useful features like **multilang text manager** using the Get Text expression, **automatic highlight** using Set Highlight action, an action for **injecting your language file** to speed up your development using Set Lang From String action, **Mute/Unmute LoL voice** api, and **automatic** management of the game **progress submission**.
